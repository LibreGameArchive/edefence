Exodus Defence is a mission based 3D action shooter. Set in a fictional near-future world you control aircraft and or fixed turrets and make use of weapons from machine guns and guided missiles to lasers.

Coded in Java, Exodus Defence is based on the JME engine and LWJGL. It will run on Windows, Mac, Linux and Solaris. It can run standalone, or inside a website as an applet.

The game is highly modifiable, with almost every aspect from the objectives of a mission or stats of a gun to the appearence of the sky or user interface, easily changed from a human readable text file. No code changes or compilation required.

Note, the goal of Exodus Defence is to test and demonstrate the possbilities for a 3D game in Java. It aims to implement all those things which a game needs. It is not intended to be ground-breaking and is not heavily optimized.
